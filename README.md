# health-data-analysis
With the Health Analytics Mini Case Study, I queried data to bring insights to the following questions:

How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?
How many total measurements do we have per user on average?
What about the median number of measurements per user?
How many users have 3 or more measurements?
How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?
Have logged blood glucose measurements?
Have at least 2 types of measurements?
Have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?
What is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values?
